    "section": "",
    "text": "Bottom trawling is a highly efficient yet ecologically disruptive fishing practice, presenting complex trade-offs between food production, biodiversity conservation, and climate mitigation. This method—dragging a weighted net along the seafloor—contributes substantially to global seafood supply but also generates significant environmental and economic challenges. Its impacts include seafloor habitat destruction, high levels of bycatch, and the release of stored carbon from marine sediments, exacerbating climate change and ecosystem degradation (Clark et al. (2016), Yesson et al. (2017), H., Virginia and M. (2009), McLaverty et al. (2021), Pusceddu et al. (2014), Hiddink et al. (2017), Sala et al. (2021)). While bottom trawling supports livelihoods and food security, these benefits must be weighed against the broader ecological and economic costs it imposes.\nThis report assesses the costs and benefits of permanently removing the industrial bottom trawling fleet from Cyprus’ national waters (within 12 n.m. from shore). It quantifies lost economic returns, including fisheries profits and employment, while evaluating environmental gains from reduced CO₂ emissions, sediment disturbance, and bycatch. The analysis also considers social impacts, particularly on food supply and alternative employment opportunities.\nBy integrating economic, social, and environmental data, this study provides data-driven insights to support evidence-based fisheries management and inform policy decisions for a more sustainable marine economy.\n\n1 Data sources\nWe compiled and analyzed data from both official and public sources.

    "text": "Overview\nBottom trawling accounts for ~21% of the total annual fishing effort in Cyprus’ Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) between 2016 and 2024 (GFW, 2025). On average, bottom trawlers operated for 3,500 hours per year, with a fleet of 2–3 vessels. In comparison, drifting longlines were the dominant gear type, representing about 61% of total fishing effort (10,100 hours per year) with an average fleet of 17 vessels. Vessels with unidentified gear types (hereafter classified as “other fishing”) contributed roughly 14% (2,300 hours per year), while set longlines and set gillnets together accounted for the remaining 5% of total effort (Figure 2.1)\nFigure 2.1: Average annual fishing effort (hours) by gear type in Cyprus’ EEZ (2016 - 2024)\nOverall, bottom trawling has occurred across 4,112 km² of Cyprus’ EEZ and 1,865 km² of its territorial waters, meaning that approximately 4.1% of the EEZ and 12.9% of the territorial waters have been trawled at least once since 2016 (GFW, 2025). This estimate is based on the cumulative area of 0.01º pixels where trawling has been detected. Using this metric, on average, 1,058 km² of the EEZ and 668.4 km² of the territorial waters are trawled annually (Figure 2.2).\nIn comparison, drifting longlines have fished across a much larger area, covering approximately 29,000 km² in total, with an annual footprint ranging from 6,000 to 14,000 km² (6–14% of the EEZ). Meanwhile, vessels classified as “other fishing” initially operated over areas exceeding 2,000 km² but have experienced a significant contraction in recent years. Notably, the spatial patterns of some vessels in the early years—such as Santa Maria and GIA SOU KAIKI MOU AI NIKOLA—resemble those of bottom trawlers, suggesting they may have engaged in trawling at least partially.\nFigure 2.2: Average annual fishing effort (hours) by gear type in Cyprus’ EEZ (2016 - 2024)\nMost bottom trawling activity in Cyprus is concentrated within territorial waters, with 88% of total effort occurring inside the 12 nautical mile (n.m.) boundary (Figure 2.3). In contrast, drifting longlines are primarily deployed beyond this zone, with 75% of their effort taking place outside territorial waters. “Other fishing” vessels also operate largely within the 12 n.m. limit, accounting for 67% of their total effort. Similarly, set longlines and set gillnets allocate approximately 75% of their fishing effort within territorial waters (GFW, 2025). These spatial distributions highlight distinct patterns of gear use, with bottom trawling and passive gears being more coastal, while drifting longlines operate predominantly in offshore areas.\nFigure 2.3: Average annual fishing effort (hours) by gear type and location in Cyprus’ EEZ.

Among them, My Hendrika II (LOA: 19.5 m, engine power: 292 kW) and Maria Mboumboulina (LOA: 24 m, engine power: 436.4 kW) account for the majority of the fishing effort, contributing 53% and 30%, respectively (GFW, 2025). These two vessels dominate bottom trawling activity in the region, while the remaining effort is distributed among three other trawlers (Table 2.1). The third most active vessel, Taxiarhis, accounts for 10% of total effort but operates primarily beyond the 12-nautical-mile (n.m.) zone, making it less relevant to this analysis of territorial waters (GFW, 2025).\n\n\n\n\nTable 2.1: Key metrics for detected trawlers in Cyprus’ EEZ\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBottom Trawling Vessel Summary\n\n\nKey metrics for detected trawlers in Cyprus’ EEZ\n\n\nVessel Name\nLength (m)\nEngine Power (kW)\nNet Width (m)\nAvg.

    "text": "Trawling Effort\nBetween 2016 and 2024, bottom trawling activity in Cyprus’ EEZ experienced notable fluctuations. From 2016 to 2018, annual effort remained relatively stable, averaging around 2,100 hours (GFW, 2025). In 2020–2021, effort increased significantly, exceeding 5,000 hours despite fewer vessels operating during this period. This peak was followed by a gradual decline, with effort stabilizing at approximately 3,000 hours by 2024 (Figure 2.4). These changes may reflect shifts in fleet composition, regulatory measures, or economic factors influencing fishing operations ((COVID?))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.4: Annual bottom trawling effort (hours) by vessel in Cyprus’ EEZ and territorial waters between 2016 and 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOfficial sources\nOfficial data provides a key validation point for our findings. According to the EU JRC Fisheries Dependent Information (FDI) Data Call, Cyprus’s bottom trawling fleet comprised between one and four active vessels per quarter from 2016 to 2023. These vessels, classified as demersal otter trawlers, ranged in length from 24 to 40 meters. Notably, the fleet appears to have undergone renewal in 2020, as the average vessel age dropped sharply from 31.5 years. Around the same time, total kilowatts (KW) and gross tonnage (GT) increased, suggesting the introduction of newer, higher-capacity vessels (Figure 2.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.5: Trends in fleet’s capacity, power, and age between 2016 and 2024\n\n\n\n\n\nAs observed in GFW data, official sources confirm that fishing effort has fluctuated considerably over this period. Before 2018, key effort metrics (fishing days, sea days, KW hours at sea, and trips) declined steadily. In 2018, these metrics showed a temporary increase, suggesting a short-term spike in activity. More recently, effort has tapered off again, indicating either a continuation of the previous downward trend or stabilization at lower levels (Figure 2.7, Figure 2.6).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.6: Fishing effort between 2016 and 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.7: Fishing effort between 2016 and 2024",

    "section": "Swept Area",
    "text": "Swept Area\nThe footprint values presented above provide a broad measure of the fleet’s operational range, but they do not fully capture the extent of seafloor disturbance. The actual impact—referred to here as the swept area—can be either smaller or larger than the detected footprint due to two key opposing factors: (1) the relatively narrow width of trawl nets (40–60 m) compared to the coarse resolution of footprint mapping (~1 km² per pixel) and (2) the repeated passes over the same fishing grounds multiple times per year (Sala et al., 2021). Consequently, in areas of low-intensity trawling, the cumulative swept area may be smaller than the detected footprint, while in heavily trawled zones, it can exceed it. This pattern is evident in Cyprus’ territorial waters, where an average of 668.4 km² (4.5%) is trawled annually, yet the cumulative swept area reaches 897.7 km² (6.1%), highlighting the concentrated nature of bottom trawling in these areas (Figure 2.8).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.8: Average annual swept area (km²) in Cyprus’territorial waters between 2016 and 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.9: Annual swept area (km²) by year in Cyprus’ territorial waters between 2016 and 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.10: Annual swept area (km²) by vessel in Cyprus’ territorial waters between 2016 and 2024\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding the spatial intensity of bottom trawling is important for assessing its ecological impact. By comparing the swept area to the size of each pixel, we estimate both the fraction of a cell fished and the frequency of trawling within it. This distinction allows us to differentiate between areas that experience occasional fishing and those subjected to repeated disturbance, which has significant implications for seafloor integrity and benthic ecosystem health (Sala et al., 2021).\nDuring the study period, the annual average swept area ratio (SAR) within territorial waters was 0.48 (median = 0.012), though the distribution was highly right-skewed (Figure 2.11). This indicates that while most areas experienced minimal disturbance, some were repeatedly trawled, concentrating fishing pressure in specific regions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.11: Distribution of average Swept Area Ratios (SAR) in Cyprus’ territorial waters between 2016 and 2024\n\n\n\n\n\nOn average, nearly half of each fished pixel’s area was directly impacted by trawling, highlighting the widespread yet uneven nature of fishing pressure. Notably, 15% of trawled areas in territorial waters had a cumulative SAR exceeding 1, meaning their entire area was trawled at least once, while 1.5% experienced SAR values over 5, with a maximum recorded SAR of 9. This means that in certain locations, the seabed was trawled multiple times within a single year, greatly increasing the risk of habitat degradation",

    "text": "Swept Volume\nTo further assess the physical impact of bottom trawling, we estimate the trawled volume by incorporating the penetration depth of the gear. While swept area provides a two-dimensional measure of disturbance, trawled volume accounts for the vertical extent of sediment disruption. For otter trawls, which are commonly used in demersal fisheries, the average penetration depth is 2.4 cm (Sala et al., 2021). By multiplying the swept area by this depth, we quantify the total volume of sediment disturbed by trawling activity.\nTo contextualize this disturbance, we also estimate the swept volume ratio (SVR) for each pixel by comparing the trawled volume to the total sediment volume within that cell. We define the volume of each pixel using a sediment depth of 1 meter, as this represents the depth of the carbon layer (Atwood et al., 2020). The SVR provides a direct estimate of the fraction of sedimentary carbon in each cell that is disturbed by trawling, offering a more precise measure of its impact on carbon stocks. The average SVR of fished areas in Cyprus’ territorial waters was 0.011 (median = 0.0003), indicating that a small fraction of the seabed’s carbon layer is directly affected by trawling activity (Figure 2.12).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.12: Distribution of average Swept Area Ratios (SVR) in Cyprus’ territorial waters between 2016 and 2024",

    "text": "Sediment disturbance\n\nCarbon Stocks\nTo estimate the total carbon stored in the top meter of marine sediment within Cyprus’ territorial waters, we used the global map of sedimentary carbon stocks produced by Atwood et al. (2020). Across the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), the total carbon stock is 710 Mt C, while within the 12 n.m. zone, it is estimated at 129 Mt C (Figure 3.2). Within territorial waters, the average carbon density is approximately 8,800 t C/km².\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: Carbon stock (t C) in Cyprus’ territorial waters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmissions\nWe follow the methodology and parameters of Sala et al. (2021) to estimate CO₂ emissions resulting from sediment disturbance caused by bottom trawling. For Cyprus’s territorial waters the relevant parameter values are the proportion of labile carbon (0.7), the proportion of resettled carbon (0.87), and the decay rate of labile carbon (12.3) for the Mediterranean Sea. Given that bottom trawling has occurred in Cyprus for over a decade, we also apply a depletion factor of 0.27 to account for the depletion of the pristine carbon pool Sala et al. (2021).\nOur findings indicate that bottom trawling in Cyprus’ territorial waters disturbs and remineralizes approximately 114,000 tons of CO₂ annually into the water columns. Of this, 50% (57,000 tons of CO₂ on average) is estimated to be exchanged with the atmosphere within a decade contributing to long-term carbon emissions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.3: CO2 emissions in Cyprus’ territorial waters\n\n\n\n\n\nTo put this into perspective, Cyprus’s total domestic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in 2022 were approximately 8.7 million tonnes of CO₂ equivalent (MtCO₂-eq), with the energy sector accounting for 34% (2.9 MtCO₂-eq) and the agriculture sector contributing around 0.52 MtCO₂-eq (6%) (European Commission, 2023).

    "text": "Landings\nTotal fish landings in the bottom trawl fishery have declined significantly since their peak in 2006, when they exceeded 200 tons. In recent years, landings have remained below 50 tons, with moderate year-to-year fluctuations. Between 2016 and 2022, annual landings averaged 76 tons (SD ≈ 14), reaching a low of 50 tons in 2020 before showing partial recovery. Overall, the data indicate a sustained decline in landings compared to earlier peak levels (Figure 4.1).\nHowever, reconstructed catch estimates suggest that total removals from the bottom trawl fishery are substantially higher than official landings data indicate. The reconstructed average annual catch for the entire fleet was estimated at 384 tons—more than five times the reported landings for the same period (Pauly and Zeller, 2025). This discrepancy highlights potential under-reporting or other factors affecting the accuracy of official landings records.\nFigure 4.1: Total annual fish catch in the bottom trawl fishery since 2006 based on official and reconstructed catch data\nBased on official data, the bottom trawl fishery is dominated by Picarei (Spicara smaris), which accounts for over 52 tons annually, far surpassing any other species. A secondary group contributes moderate landings, including Red mullet (Mullus barbatus) and Bogue (Boops boops), both around 11.5 tons, followed by European squid (Loligo vulgaris, 5.8 tons), Common Pandora (Pagellus erythrinus, 4.9 tons), and Axillary seabream (Pagellus acarne, 4.0 tons)(Figure 4.2).\nSmaller contributions come from Common octopus (Octopus vulgaris, 2.4 tons) and Striped red mullet (Mullus surmuletus, 2.1 tons). Most other species land less than 1 ton per year, with European hake (Merluccius merluccius, 0.97 tons) and Giant red shrimp (Aristaeomorpha foliacea, 0.18 tons) among the more notable. Overall, Picarei dominates the fishery, while a handful of other species contribute moderate or minor but steady landings (Figure 4.2).\nFigure 4.2: Total annual fish catch by taxa in the bottom trawl fishery since 2006",

    "text": "Discards\nOn average, the total annual discards since 2016 across all species amount to approximately 1.67 tons per year, reflecting the overall scale of non-retained catch in the bottom trawl fishery (fig-discards-ts, Figure 4.4). However, reconstructed data suggests this value can be as high as 245 tons per year (Figure 4.3) (Pauly and Zeller, 2025). This discrepancy highlights the substantial difference between official and reconstructed catch data, indicating that discards may be a significant component of the fishery that is not fully captured in official records.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.3: Total annual discards by taxa in the bottom trawl fishery since 2006\n\n\n\n\n\nPicarei (Spicara smaris) dominates discards in the bottom trawl fishery, with a total of 34.6 tons across all years, averaging 2.5 tons per year—far exceeding any other species. This aligns with its prominence in landings, suggesting it is both highly targeted and frequently discarded, likely due to market preferences or selectivity issues. Common Pandora (Pagellus erythrinus) follows at a distant second, with 5.3 tons total and 0.4 tons annually, while Bogue (Boops boops), Spotted flounder (Citharus linguatula), and Red mullet (Mullus barbatus) contribute between 1.2 and 2.4 tons total, averaging 0.1 to 0.3 tons per year. A notable shift is seen in Spotted flounder, which had relatively high discard levels before 2018, peaking at 1 ton in 2016, but are almost absent afterward. This suggests potential shift in stock dynamics affecting its presence in catches (Figure 4.4).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.4: Total annual discards by taxa in the bottom trawl fishery since 2006\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPauly, D. and Zeller, D.

These costs have more than doubled, rising from approximately 167k EUR in 2016 to 364k EUR by 2022, likely driven by increasing fuel price. Depreciation follows as the second-largest cost category, averaging 114k EUR per year. Unlike energy costs, depreciation has gradually declined from 131k EUR in 2016 to below 98k EUR in 2022, likely reflecting reduced investment in new vessels or aging fleet assets with lower replacement values. This stands in contrast with earlier data suggest newer vessels were introduced in the fleet, which could have led to higher depreciation costs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.2: Total annual costs in the bottom trawl fishery by type\n\n\n\n\n\nCrew wages average 94k EUR, showing a sharp decline after 2016 before recovering to approximately 100k EUR between 2019 and 2021 (Figure 5.2, Figure 5.3). This fluctuation may be linked to changes in fleet size, effort reductions, or shifts in labor market conditions affecting wage structures in the fishery. Repair costs stand at 79k EUR on average, following a clear downward trend from 122k EUR in 2016 to just 40k EUR in 2022. This decline could be due to reduced fishing effort, fleet contraction, or operational adjustments that limit wear and tear on vessels. Smaller but still relevant cost components include variable costs (~72k EUR) and non-variable costs (~37k EUR), which fluctuate year to year but remain well below the major expenses (Figure 5.3).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.3: Total annual costs in the bottom trawl fishery by type",

Using a 5% discount rate, the NPV is -92,911 EUR, indicating sustained financial losses and an unlikely path to profitability. At a 10% discount rate, which accounts for higher financial risk and opportunity costs, the NPV improves slightly but remains negative at -73,934 EUR. These results underscore the structural financial challenges facing the fishery.\nLooking at profitability per unit of fishing effort provides a more nuanced view of the fishery’s economic performance. While revenue per trip generally increased after 2016 — peaking in 2021 as total effort declined — costs per trip also climbed at a similar pace, spiking in 2019 and 2022 (Figure 5.6). This dynamic led to profit swings: losses in 2016–2017, a brief positive turn in 2018, a low point in 2019, a rebound in 2020, a high in 2021, and a return to slight losses by 2022 (Figure 5.6). This pattern suggests that reducing effort alone has not been enough to stabilize profitability, as rising costs continue to offset revenue gains.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.6: Revenue, total costs and net profits per fishing trip (2016 - 2022)",

Beyond direct industry revenue, this fishery may plays an important role in food security and nutrition, supplying valuable protein to local and regional markets.\nOne approach to estimate this contribution is to calculate how much it would cost to replace the protein provided by the fishery with an alternative source, such as chicken. With a protein-to-weight ratio of 0.18, the fishery’s average annual landings of 76 tons provide approximately 17 tons of high-quality protein per year. If chicken were used as a substitute—given its higher protein-to-weight ratio of 0.32—it would take 53 tons of chicken to replace the fishery’s protein contribution. At a market price of €5 per kilogram, this substitution would amount to €272,000 per year (Figure 6.1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.1: Total value of the protein contribution from bottom trawling (2016 - 2020)\n\n\n\n\n\nThis estimate underscores the often overlooked economic and nutritional value of the fishery.

    "text": "Beyond financial losses and carbon emissions, discards and bycatch represent another significant external cost of bottom trawling. Bycatch refers to non-target species caught unintentionally, while discards include both unwanted bycatch and low-value target species that are thrown back, often with low survival rates (Kelleher, 2005). These unintended catches reduce biodiversity, disrupt marine food webs, and can negatively impact populations of commercially valuable species (Davies et al., 2009).\nDespite its ecological significance, valuing the full impact of by-catch on marine ecosystems and associated fisheries remains extremely challenging and is beyond the scope of this analysis. However, to approximate its economic cost, we apply a very conservative market-based approach, valuing discarded fish at the 25th percentile price of species commonly caught in bottom trawl fisheries across Europe, estimated at 911 EUR per ton (Millage, In review). While this method does not capture the broader ecological damage caused by discarding, it provides a minimum estimate of the direct economic loss associated with wasteful fishing practices.\nUsing official discard estimates of 1.67 tons per year, the economic loss is valued at only ~1,000 EUR annually. However, if true discards are closer to what Sea Around Us (SAU) suggests—an average of 245 tons per year—then the economic loss would rise to approximately 223,000 EUR per year.\n\n\n\n\nDavies, R.W.D. et al.

    "text": "The economic impact of bottom trawling extends beyond private financial returns, incorporating both public benefits and societal costs. While the industry is often evaluated based on profitability, a more comprehensive assessment considers its broader contributions to society and its environmental footprint.\nFrom a private utility perspective, the fishery’s value lies in profits, which fluctuate with market conditions, operating costs, and regulations. In contrast, its public utility is more complex, balancing positive contributions, such as employment and food security, against negative externalities, including bycatch (not assessed here), discards, and CO₂ emissions. While the fishery supports jobs and provides protein, it also depletes marine resources and contributes to climate change through both fuel combustion and sediment disturbance, which releases stored carbon into the ocean.\nOn average, private utility was negative (-12,000 EUR per year, SD: 118,000 EUR), indicating that fishing costs generally exceeded revenue despite year-to-year variability (Figure 9.1). High energy expenses, depreciation, and crew wages were the primary cost drivers. Even as fishing effort declined in recent years, fuel and repair costs remained high, sustaining negative net profits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.1: Public and Private Utility from Bottom Trawling\n\n\n\n\n\nThe public utility of bottom trawling showed even larger negative values, as external costs—primarily CO₂ emissions—far outweighed societal benefits such as employment and protein provision. While the fishery contributed an estimated 214 EUR per year (SD: 39,000 EUR) in protein value and 186,000 EUR per year (SD: 43,000 EUR) in employment, these gains were dwarfed by the climate costs of CO₂ emissions (Figure 9.1).\nUsing a conservative social cost of carbon (50 EUR per ton of CO₂), emissions from fuel combustion alone imposed an average annual cost of 34,600 EUR (SD: 11,700 EUR). However, the most significant climate impact came from sediment disturbance, generating an estimated annual carbon cost of 2.5 million EUR (SD: 1.1 million EUR) (Figure 9.1). This staggering figure underscores the hidden environmental burden of bottom trawling, reinforcing the need to account for both private profitability and the broader social and ecological costs of this fishing practice.",

    "text": "Given the persistent negative profitability of the bottom trawl fishery and its substantial environmental costs, a complete ban on trawling is a policy option that warrants serious consideration. A well-structured vessel buyout program could facilitate an orderly transition, ensuring a just and economically viable exit strategy for fishers while delivering long-term ecological and societal benefits.\nWith consistent financial losses, minimal employment benefits, and an annual carbon footprint exceeding 2.5 million EUR, bottom trawling imposes far greater costs on society than the value it provides. A government-funded buyout program, paired with alternative employment pathways, would enable a phased and fair transition away from this destructive fishing practice, ensuring that affected fishers are not left behind.\nVessel buyouts, in which fishers are compensated to permanently remove their boats from the fishery, have been successfully implemented worldwide to reduce overcapacity, restore fish stocks, and mitigate economic hardship. Following the collapse of Atlantic cod stocks in Canada in the 1990s, a CAD 1.9 billion buyout program helped restructure the industry and alleviate economic distress (Schrank, 2005). In the U.S., a $100 million buyout in the Pacific groundfish fishery led to improved economic conditions for remaining fishers while reducing pressure on depleted stocks (PFMC, 2004). Similarly, Australia’s Northern Prawn Fishery implemented a voluntary buyout program, resulting in both economic and ecological improvements (Vieira, Schirmer and Loxton, 2010).\nGiven that the fleet operates at a net loss, the NPV of future operations is negative, and the external costs of trawling are substantial, the compensation value per vessel should be primarily based on market value, adjusted to account for economic hardship and alternative employment opportunities. A reasonable buyout offer would be calculated as market value (estimated using recent sales data, adjusted for depreciation) minus future losses avoided, ensuring a cost-effective transition for the government while providing fair compensation for vessel owners.\nIf additional funds are available, the buyout package should also include support for fishers to transition into alternative livelihoods, such as sustainable fisheries, aquaculture, or maritime tourism, helping to minimize economic displacement and foster long-term employment stability. By implementing a well-designed buyout program, policymakers can ensure that the phase-out of bottom trawling is both economically feasible and socially responsible, paving the way for a more sustainable and equitable fishing sector\n\n\n\n\nPFMC (2004) “Pacific fishery management council, pacific groundfish buyback program.” Available at: https://www.pcouncil.org.\n\n\nSchrank, W.E.
